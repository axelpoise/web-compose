# Web Compose
Web Compose is a library for creating web views purely in typescript. The underlying implementation of those views is abstracted away from the user, though it is possible to combine web compose with other viewable components. 
The inspiration from Web Compose comes from SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose in mobile development.
